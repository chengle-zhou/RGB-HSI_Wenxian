The RGB image and the HSI are respectively captured by Sentinel-2 (on November 14, 2019) and GF-5 (on November 10, 2019) over Wenxian, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China. Note that, Sentinel-2 data contains 12 spectral bands with three spatial resolutions (i.e., 10, 20, and 60 m). We selected the R, G, and B bands with 10 m spatial resolution to construct an RGB image with 30 m spatial resolution based on mean aggregation downsampling. GF-5 data are collected by the Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI) sensor, with an image spatial resolution of 30 m and 330 spectral bands from the spectral range 400-2500 nm. For the Wenxian dataset, 78 spectral bands with high signal-to-noise ratio (400-730 nm) in the V-NIR spectral range were selected as the HSI, and the ground-truth (comprising 6 land-cover classes) is made available by us.
